# Roadmap
 
PR Pilot is currently in early stage of development. To fulfill our [vision](vision.md), 
there are several milestones to be reached, which are defined [in Github](https://github.com/PR-Pilot-AI/pr-pilot/milestones).
This page roughly outlines the main goals we want to achieve in the near future.

## Stabilize the Core Functionality
The quality of the results is a top priority. In order to be a useful 
companion for developers, PR Pilot needs to be reliable and provide high-quality results. 

## Implement Continuous Learning
As you use PR Pilot, it should be able to learn from your interactions and improve its performance over time, this includes:
* Learning from the feedback you provide
* Learning from insights it gets from reading your code
* Retrieving that knowledge in the right place at the right time

## Become a Platform
Users should be able to trigger new tasks not just from Github, but from other platforms as well.
This includes:
* Integrating with other platforms like Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc.
* Providing a REST API to trigger tasks from your own tools
* Integrating with other tools like Slack, Jira, etc.

## Support for More Language Models
We are currently using the API from OpenAI. In the future, we want to offer the possibility to host and run
our own language models in order to provide a higher level of privacy and control over your data.
